# arkham-horror-the-worlds-of-android

This repository contains various different ways to print and play the _Arkham Horror: The Card Game_ fan expansion _The Worlds of Android_.

Not for sale.

## Campaign Guide

`campaign-guide` contains the campaign guide split into 3 PDFs to keep their size small. Center it and/or fit onto your paper size and print them out.

## Cards

Print these at "actual size". If you set the margins so that they're centered, the cards will line up and you can print it double-sided if you want.

### Minis

`minis` contains a version of the minis with bleed and a version without. This includes all of the cyber avatars, all the investigators, and 4 copies of the cyberspace/meatspace helper cards. These are small enough to fit onto both A4 and US Letter paper sizes.

### Cards with bleed

`print-and-play-a4-bleed` and `print-and-play-letter-bleed` have versions that fit onto A4 and US Letter.

### Cards without bleed

`print-and-play-no-bleed` contains the cards in a grid without bleed. This minimises cutting, but card art will leak onto each other. These are small enough to fit onto both A4 and US Letter paper sizes.
